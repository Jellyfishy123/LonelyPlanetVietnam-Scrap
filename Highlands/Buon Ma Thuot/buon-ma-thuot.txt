This excellent museum takes you through the history of Dak Lak province, from stone tools and bronze burial drums to the American War and its aftermath, written from the North Vietnamese perspective.
The ethnography section introduces the matriarchal Ede, M'nong and Jarai people through outstanding photography, displays of traditional clothing, musical instruments and ritual objects such as the buffalo sacrifice pole.
Entry is from the north side.

This monument commemorates the events of 10 March 1975 when VC and North Vietnamese troops liberated the city.
Itâ€™s an interesting piece of socialist-realist sculpture, consisting of a column supporting a central group of figures holding a flag, with a modernist arch forming a rainbow over a concrete replica tank.

Something of an oasis in busy Buon Ma Thuot, this efficient hotel a couple of kilometres from the city centre offers comfortable, spotless, sensibly priced rooms set around a landscaped garden.
Superior rooms are larger and have a balcony.
The grounds include the appealingly rustic 'coffee village', complete with an Ede longhouse.
.
It's not a hostel, but this cheapie attracts international travellers with its English- and French-speaking family who can arrange tours of the area and onward transport.
Rooms are plain but clean (the singles are small), with decent mattresses, and are fine for a night or two.
Motorbikes (75,000/150,000d per half/full day) can be rented.
Only the more expensive streetside rooms with balcony have much natural light.
.
This gleaming tower rises above the most central intersection in town, across from the Catholic Church, but guests at Buon Ma Thuot's swishest hotel are sufficiently high up to be insulated from street sounds.
Rooms aren't as flash as the imposing exterior suggests, with ageing carpets, but they are spacious, business-hotel-standard lodgings.
.
This budget joint is popular with Easy Riders and their clients.
Rooms are characterless, but clean and big enough, though ask for a back-block room with shared balcony and view, rather than the windowless cheaper rooms.
Staff are helpful and some English is spoken.
It's a 20-minute walk from the centre of town.
.
Every third shop in Buon Ma Thuot is a coffee house, but this one from a rated local coffee producer (you can buy bags of its beans here) stands out, with its spacious interior and smooth brews.
Also does smoothies and tea.
.
There's really only one dish at this welcoming and popular place: delicious, roll-your-ownnem nuong(rice-paper rolls, with salad, crudites, herbs and fried pork sausage, served with peanut sauce).
.
Upscale Vietnamese cuisine in refined but relaxed surroundings, with excellent service.
Try the clay-pot dishes or the excellent fish soups delicately seasoned with basil and tamarind.
The Vietnamese menu has many more options if you can navigate it, but neither has many choices for vegetarians.
It's a 15-minute walk from the centre.
.
For a fabulous quick lunch or breakfast, this roadside stall does fantastic crab noodle soup.
Throw in the provided green leaves, lime, fish sauce and purple shrimp paste and mix it all together for a taste explosion.
