A freewheeling architectural exploration of surrealism, Hang Nga Crazy House is a joyously designed, outrageously artistic private home.
Imagine sculptured rooms connected by super-slim bridges rising out of a tangle of concrete greenery, an excess of cascading lava-flow-like shapes, wild colours, spiderweb windows and an almost organic quality to it all, with the swooping handrails resembling jungle vines.
Think of Gaudí and Tolkien dropping acid together and designing their own version of Disneyland.
The brainchild of owner Mrs Dang Viet Nga, the Crazy House has been an imaginative work in progress since 1990.
Hang Nga, as she’s known locally, has a PhD in architecture from Moscow and has designed a number of other buildings around Dalat.
Her father, Truong Chinh, succeeded Ho Chi Minh as Vietnam’s second president from 1981 until his death in 1988, which is perhaps one reason that planning permission doesn't seem to be a problem.
There’s a shrine to him in the ground-floor lounge.
A note of caution for those with young kids: the Crazy House's maze of precarious tunnels, high walkways with low guard rails and steep ladders is not at all child-safe.
.
From Dalat’s wonderful art deco train station you can ride one of the nine scheduled trains that run to Trai Mat (return from 108,000d, 30 minutes) daily between 6.
55am and 4.
39pm; a minimum of 25 passengers is required.
Acrémaillère(cog railway) linking Dalat and Thap Cham from 1928 to 1964 was closed due to VC attacks.
A Japanese steam train is on display alongside a collection of old carriages.
At Trai Mat you can visit the impressively kitschLinh Phuoc Pagoda, just a couple of hundred metres from the station.
.
En route between Bao Loc and Ho Chi Minh City, 130km southwest of Dalat, Dambri Falls are one of the highest (90m), most magnificent and easily accessible waterfalls in Vietnam – they are worth visiting even in dry season.
For some incredible views, ride thevertical cable car(more of an elevator, really), or trudge up the steep path, to the top of the falls.
A second path leads down some steep stairs to the front of the falls for more great views, and carries on down to the smallerDasara Falls, or you can take the alpine coaster from the centre at the entrance to the falls.
The surrounding complex includes a hotel, Ferris wheel and water slides.
The road to the falls branches off Hwy 20, 18km north of Bao Loc.
Buses travelling between Dalat and Ho Chi Minh City will drop you at the junction.
From there, you'll have to negotiate with axe omdriver for a ride to the falls.
Expect to pay 150,000d.
.
This coffee farm has been in the family of Rolan since the 1860s.
It's part of a K'Ho coffee-growing cooperative that ensures profits directly support K'Ho minority farmers.
The beans are arabica, including varieties grown in Africa, which are rarely found in Vietnam.
If you call Josh and Rolan in advance, you can stop by to see the plantation and pick up some Fair Trade, locally roasted beans.
It also stocks beautiful traditional weavings done by the K'Ho women in the community.
Predominantly blue and intricately embroidered, each takes weeks to complete; prices start from 1,200,000d.
The farm is 10km north of Dalat near Lat, a collection of nine hamlets made up of Chill, Ma and K'Ho people and worth a visit.
.
Built by a French merchant in 1929, the surprisingly modest but attractive royal residence of Bao Dai (1913–97), Vietnam's last emperor, beckons visitors with its beautiful tree-lined avenue.
It was home to Bao Dai and his family until they went into exile in France in 1954.
The house was subsequently taken over by then Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem.
Highlights are the emperor's coronation photos and the easily missed secret doorway, disguised as a bookcase, that leads through tunnels to a parked Huey helicopter.
For 40,000d you can have your photo taken next to a waxwork likeness of Bao Dai.
.
The Truc Lam Pagoda enjoys a hilltop setting and has immaculately tended flower and bonsai gardens.
It's an active monastery, though the grounds frequently teem with tour groups.
Be sure to arrive bycable car, which soars over majestic pine forests; the terminus is 3km south of Dalat centre, up a short road next to the long-distance bus station.
The pagoda can also be reached by road via turn-offs from Hwy 20.
.
Less than 1km from the base of Lang Bian Mountain is Lat Village (pronounced ‘lak’), a fairly unremarkable minority community of about 6000 people spread across nine hamlets.
Only five of Lat Village's hamlets are actually Lat; residents of the other four are members of the Chill, Ma and K'Ho tribes.
It's worth peeking into the Catholic church for a glimpse of a K'Ho ritual pole alongside the altar.
.
Created by a dam in 1919, this banana-shaped lake was named after an anti-authoritarian 17th-century Vietnamese poet.
It has become a popular icon of Dalat and a magnet for joggers and honeymooners.
The lake can be circumnavigated on a scenic 7km path.
.
These gardens were established in 1966 and include hydrangeas, fuchsias and orchids, the latter in shaded buildings to the left of the entrance.
Like any good Vietnamese park, the gardens have been embellished with kitsch topiary.
.
This complex comprises a large prayer hall, a dragon made from more than 10,000 beer bottles, a seven-storied pagoda, a massive Bodhisattva of Compassion made from flowers and an adjoining hall with an impressive standing Bodhisattva.
Everything is covered in enough coloured tiles to give kitsch a bad name.
Pretty it’s not, but it is certainly impressive in its extravagance.
It’s 10km east of Dalat centre, near Trai Mat, and best visited after a scenic train ride from Dalat's old train station.
.
Occupying a densely forested highland plateau, this little-visited national park encompasses coniferous woodlands, bamboo groves and grasslands at altitudes between 650m and 2288m.
It is also home to various primates, black bears and the vampire flying frog.
Possible hikes include Thien Thai Waterfall (3.
5km), Lang Biang Peak (9km) and an overnight camping trip to Bidoup mountain.
The park is 50km north of Dalat and most people visit on a motorbike tour.
English-speaking staff can be elusive.
.
Named after a large rock that allegedly resembles an elephant's head, these powerful curved falls are reached by a steep ascent along uneven, very slippery stone steps with intermittent railings.
You can squeeze through a cave to get behind the falls and be doused with bracing spray.
The falls are near Nam Ban village, 30km southwest of Dalat.
Local buses (20,000d, one hour) leave for Nam Ban from behind Dalat's main square every 40 minutes or so between 6am and 6pm.
.
This is the closest waterfall to Dalat, so expect crowds.
You can reach the cascade (which is pretty but quite modest) either by walking down or taking a short bobsled on rails ride (adult/child 80,000/40,000d).
A longer, new alpine rollercoaster (adult/child return 150,000/80,000d) also runs from a few hundred metres away.
Datanla is 7km south of Dalat.
Take Hwy 20 and turn right about 200m past the turn-off to Truc Lam Pagoda and Tuyen Lam Lake.
.
This hillside museum is a stampede through Dalat's history, with a side trip into natural history, complete with outrageously bad taxidermy, and plenty of propaganda.
Highlights include evocative photos of the Ma, K'Ho and Churu people and displays of their traditional dress, musical instruments and ceremonial altars.
Check out the remarkable stone xylophones dating back more than 3000 years.
.
Flanked by enormous coiling concrete dragons rearing out of a pond, and with a fabulously kitsch outdoor tableau featuring the young Buddha atop a lotus flower, this is Dalat's oldest and most colourful pagoda.
Founded in 1931 it had to be extensively restored after the American War.
.
Built in 1938, the Linh Son Pagoda is a lovely ochre-coloured building that fuses French and Chinese architecture.
The giant bell is said to be made of bronze mixed with gold, with its great weight making it too heavy for thieves to carry off.
.
The gingerbread-style Dalat Cathedral was built between 1931 and 1942 for use by French residents and holidaymakers.
The cross on the spire is topped by a weathercock, 47m above the ground.

More a homestay than a guesthouse, with just four individually decorated rooms, all comfortable, as well as pleasant communal areas and an upstairs Middle Eastern–style shisha cafe.
The cheaper ground-floor rooms don't have windows but are still pleasant.
Owner Yom is helpful with restaurant suggestions and scooter rental.
Find it up a steep alley off the street, on the left.
An overspill hotel a few doors further down offers brighter, spacious rooms (double 350,000d to 450,000d) with balcony but less of a homestay vibe.
.
Elegant, secluded property spread across seven lovingly restored French-colonial villas in the peaceful western suburbs.

The spa, pool and restaurant are all excellent.
.
Look down from this villa on the hill and the whole of Dalat opens up in the valley.

The most expensive are equipped with triangular bath-tubs.
Staff is helpful and knowledgeable, and motorbikes (100,000d per day) can be hired.
.
With unimpeded views of Xuan Huong Lake, this grande dame of Dalat hotels has vintage Citroën cars in its sweeping driveway, and lashings of wood panelling and period class.
The opulence of French-colonial life has been splendidly preserved – claw-foot tubs, fireplaces, chandeliers and oil paintings – though in low season the cavernous, silent hallways feel like something out ofThe Shining.
Look for online deals.
The hotel was originally built as the Lang Bien Palace Hotel in 1922 and was restored in the 1990s by Larry Hillblom, then joint-owner of DHL.

Deluxe rooms are worth the extra money.

Belying its location close to two of Dalat's most upmarket hotels, this five-year veteran offers surprising comfort at budget prices on a quiet street.

Caffeine fiends will want to head to this unique mix of coffee shop, farm and factory.

.
A surreal drinking experience.
The owners claim Gandalf and his hobbit friends have drunk here, and the labyrinth of rooms with multiple nooks and crannies, multilevel grottoes and fantastical sculptures does resemble a Middle Earth location.
A happy hour (6pm to 8pm) and Wonderland-like rooftop garden add to the wide-eyed fun.
Fittingly, it's also called the Maze Bar.
.
Dalat's hipster hang-out (for alcohol imbibers, anyway), with a DJ every night in the small dark interior and a nicer outside terrace at which to sip pretty good cocktails (from 70,000d).
