Come here for a stupendous private collection of military arms, uniforms and paraphernalia from across the globe.
One section is dedicated to the conflict in Vietnam, another to the French Colonial period and there are Chinese, European and even Zulu exhibits.
Robert Taylor, who has spent 50 years amassing and curating the collection, is often at hand to provide explanations.
The attention to detail is superb and there are excellent descriptions in English and Vietnamese.

Atop Small Mountain with his arms outstretched to embrace the South China Sea (East Sea), this 32m giant Jesus is one of the biggest in the world – taller than his illustrious Brazilian cousin.
It's possible to ascend to the arms for a panoramic view of Vung Tau.
Note you cannot enter the actual statue in vest-tops or shorts.
Some 800-odd stairs wind their way up the mountain, a Vietnamese version of stairway to heaven, but it is possible to take a short cut by motorbike up a bumpy mountain road if you can find a local who knows the way.
It starts from Hem 220, off Ð Phan Chu Trinh.
.
These six massive cannons, all with support trenches, demonstrate how strategically important Cap St Jacques was to the colonial authorities (it guarded access to Saigon).
To reach them take Ð Tran Phu beyond Mulberry Beach and look for Hem 444 in the fishing village, about 6km from Vung Tau.
Turn right up a narrow, rough track manageable by motorbike or on foot.
.
Built by the French, this 1910 lighthouse boasts a spectacular 360° view of Vung Tau.
From Cau Da Pier on Ð Ha Long, take a sharp right on the alley north of the Hai Au Hotel, then roll on up the hill.
Although Jesus and the lighthouse look temptingly close, it is not possible to walk or drive directly between them; there is a military base in the hills here.
.
The weekend retreat of French governor Paul Doumer (later a French president), this gorgeous, grand colonial-era residence has extensive gardens bursting with frangipani.
The interior is oddly empty (besides the odd piece of furniture and some Ming pottery retrieved from shipwrecks off the coast).
It sits about 30m above the road, up a winding lane.
.
Just off the promenade.

Jutting into the bay, this white-and-purple art deco structure is something of a local landmark.

Best of all, when you need a beer, the bar's just downstairs.

With tables by the ocean, this wonderful seafood restaurant boasts the perfect setting.
Don't be put off by its size (Ganh Hao is huge and seats hundreds) as service is pretty efficient and you shouldn't have to wait too long for your meal.
Try sublime crab (great with pepper sauce), clams, squid, prawn, fish claypot and seafood hotpots.
There's a secondbranchby the ferry terminal but we prefer the original's setting and ambience.
.
A chic, casual French bistro-deli with a fine pavement terrace.

Bread is baked daily on the premises.
