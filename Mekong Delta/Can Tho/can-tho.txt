The biggest floating market in the Mekong Delta, Cai Rang is 6km from Can Tho in the direction of Soc Trang.
There's a bridge here that serves as a great vantage point for photography.
The market is best around 6am to 7am, and it's well worth getting here early to beat the boatloads of tourists and the heat.
This is a wholesale market, so look at what's tied to the long pole above the boat to see what they're selling.
Cai Rang can be seen from the road, but getting here is far more interesting by boat (US$10 to US$15).
From the market area in Can Tho it takes about 45 minutes by boat to the market, or you can drive to the Cau Dau Sau boat landing (about 4km southwest of Can Tho by the Dau Sau Bridge), skipping the least interesting section of river, from where it takes only about 10 minutes to reach the market.

In a fantastic location facing the Can Tho River and decorated with huge, constantly burning incense coils, this Chinese temple is set inside theGuangzhou Assembly Hall, and wandering through its fragrant, smoke-filled interior is very enjoyable.
It was originally built in the late 19th century to worship Kuang Kung, a deity symbolising loyalty, justice, reason, intelligence, honour and courage, among other merits.
Wait long enough and you'll see how the incense coils are lit and hung on long poles.
Approaching the engraved screen, the right side is dedicated to the Goddess of Fortune and the left side is reserved for the worship of General Ma Tien.
In the centre of the temple is Kuang Kung flanked by the God of Earth and the God of Finance.
.
An intimate floating market, Phong Dien has more stand-up rowing boats than motorised craft, with local vendors shopping and exchanging gossip.
Less crowded thanCai Rang, it has far fewer tourists and less activity.
It's most bustling between 5am and 7am, with little to see later.
The market is 20km southwest of Can Tho; get here by road or sign up for a six-hour combined Cai Rang–Phong Dien tour, returning to Can Tho through quiet backwaters.

Dating from 1870, the Binh Thuy house was built by wealthy merchant Duong Chan Ky and extensively renovated in the French colonial style in the early 20th century.
The interior of the house is very much original, with ornate hand-painted floor tiles, elaborate decorative wood carvings and huge floor-to-ceiling display cabinets.
The house was a main location in the film adaptation ofThe Lover(L'Amant), directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud in 1992.
.
Trying to hide down a quiet backstreet, but gloriously gilded in gold, this rare three-level Khmer Theravada Buddhist pagoda from 1948 contrasts sharply against the adjacent grey buildings.

Its charitable pursuits include helping disadvantaged youths to study.
.
This large, well-presented museum brings local history to life with mannequins and life-size reproductions of buildings, including a Chinese pagoda and a house interior.

.
This small golden pagoda was originally built in 1946 to serve Can Tho’s Khmer community.
The ornamentation is typical of Khmer Theravada Buddhist pagodas, with none of the multiple Bodhisattvas and Taoist spirits common in Vietnamese Mahayana pagodas.

Not a shack, but rather a clutch of rustic thatched bungalows with fans, this great place overlooks the Ong Tim River, 6km from Can Tho.
It's the kind of place where backpackers are inspired to linger longer, thanks to the camaraderie between English-speaking staff and guests.

An attached restaurant isn't cheap but serves great food.
It's also pretty convenient for the bus station, as it's southwest of the city.

Live music most nights, including open mics, and chilled beers.
.
With a charming, romantic Mediterranean feel, this restaurant does a good mix of Vietnamese and Western dishes.

The six-dish set menus (from 210,000d) are a steal.
.
Set under a soaring series of thatched roofs that could be a modernist take on a traditional tribal house, this is the most sophisticated Vietnamese dining experience in Can Tho, set on a private headland jutting into the river.

It's packed with local diners most nights and does draw some tour groups, but for good reason.
It's large enough to lose yourself from the crowd.

Across the road is the cloth market and behind that is a building full of bags, belts and jewellery.
