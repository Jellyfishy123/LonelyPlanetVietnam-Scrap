Built two centuries ago by an ethnically Vietnamese family, this gem of a house has been lovingly preserved through seven generations.
Look out for signs of Japanese and Chinese influences in the architecture.
Japanese elements include the ceiling (in the sitting area), which is supported by three progressively shorter beams, one on top of the other.
Under the crab-shell ceiling are carvings of crossed sabres wrapped in silk ribbon.
The sabres symbolise force; the silk represents flexibility.
The interior is brightened by a beautiful detail: Chinese poems written in inlaid mother-of-pearl hang from some of the columns that hold up the roof.
The Chinese characters on these 150-year-old panels are formed entirely of birds gracefully portrayed in various positions of flight.
The carved wooden balcony supports around the courtyard are decorated with grape leaves, which are a European import and further evidence of the unique blending of cultures in Hoi An.
The back of the house faces the river and was rented out to foreign merchants.
There are two pulleys attached to a beam in the loft – in the past they were used for moving goods into storage, and today for raising furniture for safekeeping from floods.
The exterior of the roof is made of tiles; inside, the ceiling consists of wood.
This design keeps the house cool in summer and warm in winter.
.
Emblematic of Hoi An, this beautiful bridge was first constructed in the 1590s by the Japanese community to link it with the Chinese quarters.
Over the centuries the ornamentation has remained relatively faithful to the original Japanese design.
When you cross using your Old Town ticket, one of the stubs will be snipped away, so if you cross the bridge again, just say your ticket stub for the bridge has been taken already, otherwise the ticket checker will remove another stub.
The structure is solidly constructed because of the threat of earthquakes.
The entrances to the bridge are guarded by weathered statues: a pair of monkeys on one side, a pair of dogs on the other.
According to one story, many of Japan’s emperors were born in the years of the dog and monkey.
Another tale says that construction of the bridge started in the year of the monkey and was finished in the year of the dog.
The stelae, listing all Vietnamese and Chinese contributors to a subsequent restoration of the bridge, are written inchu nho(Chinese characters) – thenomscript had not yet become popular.
The French flattened out the roadway for cars, but the original arched shape was restored in 1986.
.
Originally a traditional assembly hall (or guildhall), this structure was later transformed into a temple for the worship of Thien Hau, a deity who protects seafarers.
The green-tiled triple gateway dates from 1975.
The mural on the right-hand wall depicts Thien Hau, her way lit by lantern light as she crosses a stormy sea to rescue a foundering ship.
Opposite is a mural of the heads of the six Fujian families who fled from China to Hoi An in the 17th century.
The penultimate chamber of this guildhall contains a statue of Thien Hau.
To either side of the entrance stand red-skinned Thuan Phong Nhi and green-skinned Thien Ly Nhan, deities who alert Thien Hau when sailors are in distress.
In the final chamber, the central altar contains seated figures of the heads of the six Fujian families.
The smaller figures below them represent their successors as clan leaders.
Behind the altar on the right are three fairies and smaller figures representing the 12ba mu(midwives), each of whom teaches newborns a different skill necessary for the first year of life: smiling, sucking and so forth.
The goddess is also worshipped by childless couples who come to pray for offspring and leave fresh fruit as offerings.
.
Built for worshipping family ancestors of the Tran (陳) clan, this chapel (more accurately an ancestral hall) dates back to 1802.
It was commissioned by Tran Tu, a member of the clan who ascended to the rank of mandarin and served as an ambassador to China.
His picture is to the right of the chapel as you enter.
The architecture of the building reflects the influence of Chinese (the 'turtle'-style roof), Japanese (triple beam) and vernacular (bow-and-arrow detailing) styles.
The wooden boxes on the altar contain the Tran ancestors’ stone tablets, with chiselled Chinese characters setting out the dates of birth and death, along with some small personal effects.
On the anniversary of each family member’s death, their box is opened, incense is burned and food is offered.
After a short tour, you’ll be shown to the ‘antique’ room, where there are lots of coins for sale, and a side room full of souvenirs.
.
By Unesco decree, more than 800 historic buildings in Hoi An have been preserved, so much of the Old Town looks as it did several centuries ago.
Eighteen of these buildings are open to visitors and require an Old Town ticket for admission; the fee goes towards funding conservation work.
Each ticket allows you to visit five different heritage attractions from a total selection of 22, including museums, assembly halls, ancient houses and a traditional music show at theHandicraft Workshop.
Tickets are valid for 10 days.
As you enter each sight, a ticket stub will be removed.
Technically, the tickets are for access into the Old Town itself, but you won't normally be checked if you're just dining or shopping in the area.
Keep your ticket with you just in case.
You could be checked for a ticket as you cross theJapanese Covered Bridge, but insisting that you are just visiting shops nearby usually works.
When the bridge is very busy with pedestrians, chances are you won't be asked either.
If a ticket stub is clipped off when you cross the bridge, say you have had one removed already next time you cross, if the ticket collectors ask again.
All four museums are small.
Displays are pretty basic and the information provided are rather minimal.
The Chinese who settled in Hoi An identified themselves according to their province of origin.
Each community built its own assembly hall or guildhall, known ashoi quanin Vietnamese, for social gatherings, meetings and religious celebrations.
All the old houses, exceptDiep Dong NguyenandQuan Thang, offer short guided tours.
They are efficient, if a tad perfunctory.
You’ll be whisked to a heavy wooden chair while your guide recites a scripted introduction to the house, and gives a souvenir soft sell.
You’re free to wander around the house after the tour.
One downside to putting these old houses on show is that what were once living spaces now seem dead and museum-like, the family having sequestered itself away from visitors’ eyes.
Huge tour groups can completely spoil the intimacy of the experience too, as they jostle for selfie shots.
Despite the number of tourists (South Koreans and Chinese in large numbers) who flood into Hoi An, it is still a conservative town.
Visitors should dress modestly, especially since some of the old houses are still private homes.
.
Behind an impressive gate emblazoned with Chinesechu nhocharacters that simply translate as 'Confucius Temple', this magnificent temple to the west of all the action is a colourful explosion of ceramic tiles.
Look out for the spirit wall across the bridge that depicts aky lan,a mythical chimerical creature often depicted in Confucian temples.
At the rear is an effigy of Confucius (Khong Tu), venerated in the 'Great Achievement Hall'.
With a dragon at each corner, the memorial pillar directly across the street overlooks a lotus-flower filled pond.
.
Just a few steps down from the Japanese Covered Bridge, this old house has a wide, welcoming entrance hall decorated with exquisite lanterns, wall hangings and embroidery.
You can walk out onto a balcony and there’s also an impressive suspended altar.
Note that with all the photographing by the crowds that squeeze onto the balcony, the staff may control numbers to avoid the risk of it collapsing.
.
Hoi An–based French photographer Réhahn has conceived this cross between museum and gallery, combining his outstanding photos of Vietnam's hill tribes with artefacts and clothing he collected from each group during his wide-ranging travels in remote areas.
If you're planning on visiting the north of the country or the Central Highlands, Precious Heritage is an essential detour.
.
Built in 1851, this assembly hall is a memorial to 108 merchants from Hainan Island who were mistaken for pirates and killed in Quang Nam province.
The elaborate dais contains plaques to their memory.
In front of the central altar is a fine gilded woodcarving of Chinese court life.
.
Founded in 1653, this small temple is dedicated to Quan Cong, an esteemed Chinese general who is worshipped as a symbol of loyalty, sincerity, integrity and justice.
His partially gilded statue, made of papier mâché on a wooden frame, is on the central altar at the back of the sanctuary.
When someone makes an offering to the portly looking Quan Cong, the caretaker solemnly strikes a bronze bowl, making a bell-like sound.
On the left of Quan Cong is a statue of General Chau Xuong, one of his guardians, striking a tough-guy pose.
On the right is the rather plump administrative mandarin Quan Binh.
The life-size white horse recalls a mount ridden by Quan Cong.
Check out the carp-shaped rain spouts on the roof surrounding the courtyard.
The carp is a symbol of patience in Chinese mythology and is popular in Hoi An.
Shoes should be removed when mounting the platform in front of the statue of Quan Cong.
.
This pagoda (founded in the mid-17th century) is associated with An Thiem, a Vietnamese prodigy and monk from the age of eight.
When he was 18, he volunteered for the army so his brothers could escape the draft; he eventually rose to the rank of general.
Later he returned to the monkhood, but to atone for his sins of war he volunteered to clean the Hoi An market for 20 years, then joined this pagoda as its head monk.
To reach the pagoda, continue past Chuc Thanh Pagoda for 500m.
The path passes an obelisk that was erected over the tomb of 13 ethnic Chinese who were decapitated by the Japanese during WWII for resistance activities.
.
There’s a whole block of colonnaded French colonial buildings on Ð Phan Boi Chau between Nos 22 and 73, among them the 19th-century Tran Duong House.
It’s still a private home, so a family member will show you around.
There's some antique French and Chinese furniture, including a sideboard buffet and a sitting-room set with elaborate mother-of-pearl inlay.
By contrast, the large, plain wooden table in the front room is the family bed.
.
Built in 1752, the highlights in this congregational hall are the gleaming woodcarvings on the beams, walls and altar – absolutely stunning in their intricacy.
You could stand here for hours to unravel the stories, but if you’re just popping by quickly, look for the carvings on the doors in front of the altar of two Chinese women wearing their hair in an unexpectedly Japanese style.
Chaozhou (潮州; also spelled in romanised form as Teochew or Chiuchow) is a city in the eastern part of Guangdong province in China, with the province of Fujian to the east.
The dialect differs greatly from Cantonese and is entirely different from Mandarin and is also of great interest to linguists as it contains many links to ancient Chinese.
.
Founded in 1773, this assembly hall was used by Fujian, Cantonese, Hainanese, Chaozhou and Hakka congregations in Hoi An.
To the right of the entrance are portraits of Chinese resistance heroes in Vietnam who died during WWII.
The well-restored main temple is a total assault on the senses, with smoking incense spirals, demonic-looking deities, dragons and lashings of red lacquer – it’s dedicated to Thien Hau, the goddess protector of seafarers commonly worshipped along the south coast of China.
.
The master woodcarvers who crafted the intricate detail adorning Hoi An’s public buildings and the historic homes of the town’s merchants came from Kim Bong village on Cam Kim Island.
Most of the woodcarvings on sale in Hoi An are produced here.
Boats to the island leave from theboat landingat Ð Bach Dang in town (35,000d, 30 minutes).
The village and island, quite rural in character, are fun to explore by bicycle for a day.
.
Founded in 1786, this assembly hall has a tall, airy entrance, which opens on to a splendidly over-the-top mosaic statue of a dragon and a carp.
The main altar is dedicated to Quan Cong, a revered Chinese general who represents many virtues, including sincerity, loyalty, integrity and justice.
The garden behind has an even more incredible dragon statue.
The goat statue at the rear is a symbol of Canton (Guangzhou), China.
.
This square well’s claim to fame is that it’s the source of water for making authenticcao lau, a Hoi An speciality.

.
Occupies a restored wooden house and contains a small collection of artefacts from all over Asia, with oddities from as far afield as Egypt.
While this reveals that Hoi An had some rather impressive trading links, it takes an expert's eye to appreciate the display.
The exhibition on the restoration of Hoi An’s old houses provides a useful crash course in Old Town architecture.
.
Founded in 1454 by a Buddhist monk from China, this is the oldest pagoda in Hoi An.

Follow the lane for 500m.
.
This house is three centuries old and was built by a Chinese captain.

.
Housed in a 200-year-old Chinese trading house, the Handicraft Workshop has artisans making silk lanterns and practising traditional embroidery in the back.

One of Hoi An's culinary secrets, Tadioto (owned and run by author, award-winning journalist and polylinguist Nguyen Qui Duc) belongs in its own charming world behind a rather dapper clothes store off Ɖ Phan Boi Chau.
The tucked-away ambience is utterly compelling, amplifying the effects of the sushi and ramen on offer.
The menu is well worth reading for entertainment alone.
The list of gin (including Song Cai Distillery gin from Vietnam) and whisky (Scotch, Japanese, Irish and American) is particularly inspiring, but Tadioto is no slouch when it comes to wine, cocktails, beer, or indeed, coffee.
An experience to savour.

Both are delicious and the restaurant is frequently packed.

Celebrity chef Duc Tran’s most beautiful Hoi An restaurant enjoys a prime riverside plot and puts a global spin on Vietnamese cuisine, with fresh, unexpected combinations.

What makes thebanh mi(filled baguettes) at this cramped joint draw the stupendous crowds out front? It's the dense, chewy bread, the freshness of the greens and the generous serves ofthit nuong(chargrilled pork),beef and other meat that seals the deal.
A celebrity-chef endorsement helps too.
.
Do the meals taste exceptional here because Streets is for a good cause? Perhaps it helps to know that the staff are disadvantaged youths trained up in hospitality, but the textbook-goodcao lauand 'white rose' dumplings deserve an A+ regardless.
Although the place is busy, the service is warm and delightful.
.
For baked goodies, 9 Grains gives it the whole nine yards: from granola at brekkie to the artisan bread,pain au chocolat, croissants, cakes and pastries, everything is superfresh and of tip-top quality.
