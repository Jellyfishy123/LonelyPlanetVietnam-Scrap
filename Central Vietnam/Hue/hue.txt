Built on a small hill overlooking the Song Huong (Perfume River), 4km southwest of the Citadel, this seven-storey pagoda is an icon of Vietnam and as potent a symbol of Hue as the Citadel.
The 21m-high octagonal tower, Thap Phuoc Duyen, was constructed under the reign of Emperor Thieu Tri in 1844.
Each of its storeys is dedicated to amanushi-buddha(a Buddha that appeared in human form).
Thien Mu Pagoda was originally founded in 1601 by Nguyen Hoang, governor of Thuan Hoa province.
Over the centuries its buildings have been destroyed and rebuilt several times.
Since the 1960s it has been a flashpoint of political demonstrations, with a notable moment coming in 1993, when a man arrived at the pagoda and, after leaving offerings, set himself alight chanting the word ‘Buddha’.
Touring the pagodaTo the right of the brick pagoda tower is a pavilion containing a stele (a stone tablet) dating from 1715.
It’s set on the back of a massive marble turtle, a symbol of longevity.
To the left of the tower is another six-sided pavilion, this one sheltering an enormous bell (1710), weighing 2052kg and audible from 10km away.
Beyond the pagoda tower is a gateway, on the upper floor of which sits an effigy of the Celestial Lady (Thien Mu) that the pagoda is named after.
Above the central portal is a board with the Chinese characters 靈姥寺 (literally 'Divine Old Woman Temple'), in honour of the presiding deity of this plot of land.
The temple itself is a humble building in the inner courtyard, past the triple-gated entrance where three statues of Buddhist guardians stand at the alert.
In the main sanctuary behind the bronze laughing Buddha are three statues: A Di Da, the Buddha of the Past; Thich Ca, the historical Buddha (Sakyamuni); and Di Lac Buddha, the Buddha of the Future.
Entrance fee and other practicalitiesThe pagoda is free to visit.
Try and arrive in the morning before large tour groups show up.
Many sights around Hue, including Thien Mu Pagoda and several of the royal tombs, can be reached by boat via the Perfume River.
Most hotels and travellers’ cafes offer shared day tours from US$5 to US$20 per person.

Taking up the southwest corner of the Imperial Enclosure, this highly impressive walled complex has been beautifully restored.
The imposing three-tieredHien Lam Pavilionsits on the south side of the complex; it dates from 1824.
On the other side of a courtyard is the solemnTo Mieu Temple, housing shrines to each of the emperors, topped by their photos.
Between these two temples areNine Dynastic Urns(dinh)cast between 1835 and 1836, each dedicated to one Nguyen sovereign.
About 2m in height and weighing 1900kg to 2600kg each, the urns symbolise the power and stability of the Nguyen throne.
The central urn, the largest and most ornate, is dedicated to dynasty founder Gia Long.
Also in the courtyard are two dragons, trapped in what look like red phone boxes.
On the north side of the complex, a gate leads into a small walled enclosure that houses theHung To Mieu Temple, a reconstruction of the 1804 original, built to honour Gia Long’s parents.
.
The Imperial Enclosure or Imperial City is a citadel-within-a-citadel, housing the emperor’s residence, temples and palaces, and the main buildings of state, within 6m-high, 2.
5km-long walls.
What’s left is only a fraction of the original – the enclosure was badly bombed during the French and American Wars, and only 20 of its 148 buildings survived.
Expect a lot of broken masonry, rubble, cracked tiling and weeds as you work your way around, but it's a fascinating site and easily worth half a day.
At a leisurely stroll, many of the less-visited areas are highly atmospheric and sublime.
It's best to choose a day with decent weather, with late afternoon (when there are fewer visitors and the sun is setting) a superb time to visit.
There are little cafes and souvenir stands dotted around.
It's best to approach the sights starting fromNgo Mon Gateand moving anticlockwise around the enclosure.
Restoration and reconstruction are ongoing.
.
This hillside monument is a synthesis of Vietnamese and European elements.
Most of the tomb’s grandiose exterior is covered in darkened, weathered concrete, with an unexpectedly Gothic air, while the interiors resemble explosions of colourful ceramic mosaic.
Khai Dinh was the penultimate emperor of Vietnam, from 1916 to 1925, and widely seen as a puppet of the French.
It took 11 years to construct his flamboyant tomb; it can be found 10km from Hue in Chau Chu village.
Steps lead to theHonour Courtyardwhere mandarin honour guards have a mixture of Vietnamese and European features.
Up three more flights of stairs is the stupendous main building,Thien Dinh.
The walls and ceiling are decorated with murals of the Four Seasons, Eight Precious Objects and the Eight Immortals.
Under a graceless, gold-speckled concrete canopy is a gilt bronze statue (cast in Marseilles) of Khai Dinh, who is presumed to have been homosexual, though he did produce one heir.
His remains are interred 18m below the statue.
There's an audio guide in a dozen languages (70,000d).
.
This tomb (completed in 1867) is the most popular, imposing and impressive of the royal mausoleums, designed by Emperor Tu Duc himself before his death.
The enormous expense of the tomb and the forced labour used in its construction spawned a coup plot that was discovered and suppressed.
Tu Duc lived a life of imperial luxury and carnal excess, with 104 wives and countless concubines (though no offspring).
The tomb is 5km south of Hue on Van Nien Hill in Duong Xuan Thuong village.
From the entrance, a path leads toLuu Khiem Lake.
The tiny island to the right,Tinh Khiem, is where Tu Duc used to hunt small game.
Across the water to the left isXung Khiem Pavilion, where he would sit with his concubines, composing or reciting poetry.
Hoa Khiem Templeis where Tu Duc and his wife, Empress Hoang Le Thien Anh, were worshipped; today it houses royal artefacts.
The larger throne was for the empress; Tu Duc was only 153cm tall.
Minh Khiem Chamber, to the right behind Hoa Khiem Temple, was originally meant to be a theatre.
Dress-up photo opportunities and cultural performances are available here.
Directly behind Hoa Khiem Temple is the quieterLuong Khiem Temple, dedicated to Tu Duc’s mother, Tu Du.
Around the lake shore is theHonour Courtyard.
You pass between a guard of elephants, horses and diminutive mandarins (even shorter than the emperor) before reaching theStele Pavilion, which shelters a vast 20-tonne stele.
Tu Duc drafted the inscriptions himself.
He freely admitted he'd made mistakes and named his tomb Khiem (Modest).
Thetomb, enclosed by a wall, is on the far side of a tiny lagoon.
It’s a drab monument and the emperor was never interred here; where his remains were buried (along with great treasures) is not known.
To keep it secret from grave robbers, all 200 servants who buried Tu Duc were beheaded.
.
Planned during Minh Mang’s reign (1820–40) but built by his successor, Thieu Tri, this majestic tomb, on the west bank of the Perfume River, is renowned for its architecture and sublime forest setting.
TheHonour Courtyardis reached via three gates on the eastern side of the wall; three granite staircases lead from here to the squareStele Pavilion(Dinh Vuong).
Sung An Temple, dedicated to Minh Mang and his empress, is reached via three terraces and the rebuilt Hien Duc Gate.
On the other side of the temple, three stone bridges spanHo Trung Minh(Lake of Impeccable Clarity).
The central bridge was for the emperor’s use only.
Toa Minh Lau(Pavilion of Light) stands on the top of three superimposed terraces that represent the ‘three powers’: the heavens, the earth and water.
To the left is the Fresh Air Pavilion, to the right, the Angling Pavilion.
From a stone bridge across crescent-shapedHo Tan Nguyet(Lake of the New Moon), a monumental staircase with dragon banisters leads to Minh Mang’s sepulchre.
The gate to the tomb is opened only once a year on the anniversary of the emperor’s death.
The tomb is in An Bang village, 12km from Hue.
.
The principal entrance to the Imperial Enclosure is Ngo Mon Gate, which faces the Flag Tower.
The central passageway with its yellow doors was reserved for the use of the emperor, as was the bridge across the lotus pond.
Others had to use the gates to either side and the paths around the pond.
On top of the gate is Ngu Phung (Belvedere of the Five Phoenixes); on its upper level is a huge drum and bell.
The name and general appearance of the gate is the same as the first gate of the Forbidden City in Beijing; thechu nho(Chinese) name of the gate is 午門 (the characters appear above the central portal), which literally means 'Meridian Gate', though it is much smaller in scale than its equivalent in north China.
The emperor appeared here on important occasions, most notably for the promulgation of the lunar calendar.
On 30 August 1945, the Nguyen dynasty ended here when Emperor Bao Dai abdicated to a delegation sent by Ho Chi Minh.
.
Wildly overgrown but evocative, Ho Quyen was built in 1830 for the royal pastime of watching elephants and tigers face off in combat.
The tigers (and leopards) were usually relieved of their claws and teeth so that the elephants – a symbol of the emperor’s power – triumphed every time.
Climb up grassy ramparts and imagine the scene in the old arena – the last fight was held in 1904.
The south-facing section was reserved for the royal family, while diametrically opposite are the tiger cages.
Ho Quyen is about 3km outside Hue in Truong Da village.
Follow Ð Bui Thi Xuan west from the train station, then look out for the blue sign near the market that indicates the turn-off on the left.
Follow this lane for about 200m to a fork in the road and go right.
.
This three-tiered esplanade was once the most important religious site in Vietnam, the place where the Nguyen emperors made animal sacrifices and elaborate offerings to the deity Thuong De.
Ceremonies (last held in 1946) involved a lavish procession and a three-day fast by the emperor at the nearby Fasting Palace.
The palace, located at the furthest end of the park, has photographs with English captions.
Since 2006, the ceremony has been re-enacted as part of theFestival of Hue.
Nam Giao Esplanade is at the southern end of Ð Dien Bien Phu, about 2km from the railway tracks.
.
Nestled in a pine forest, this pagoda was built in 1843 and later co-opted by eunuchs from the Citadel.
Today 70 monks reside at Tu Hieu; they welcome visitors to the twin temples (one dedicated to Cong Duc, the other to Buddha).
Listen to their chanting daily at 4.
30am, 10am, noon, 4pm and 7pm.
Tu Hieu Pagoda is about 5km from the centre of Hue, on the way to thetomb of Tu Duc.
Tu Hieu is associated with Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh, who studied at the monastery in the 1940s, but lived in exile for more than 40 years and was only permitted to return to Vietnam in 2005.
.
In the very centre of the Imperial Enclosure, there's almost nothing left of the once-magnificent Purple Forbidden City.
This was a citadel-within-a-citadel-within-a-citadel and was reserved solely for the personal use of the emperor – the only servants allowed into this compound were eunuchs, who would pose no threat to the royal concubines.
The Purple Forbidden City was almost entirely destroyed in the wars, and its crumbling remains are now overgrown with weeds.
The name 'Purple Forbidden City' is the same as the full name of the Forbidden City at the heart of Beijing in China.
.
The Royal Theatre, begun in 1826 and later home to the National Conservatory of Music, has been rebuilt on its former foundations.
When performances aren't on, it's free to sit in the plush chairs or examine the fascinating display of masks and musical instruments from Vietnamese theatre, with English descriptions.
Cultural performances here last 40 minutes.
Southeast of here almost nothing remains of theThai To Mieutemple complex (it's now a plant nursery) and the formerUniversity of Arts.
.
Covering an area of 250 hectares, the cemetery behind the fishing village of An Bang holds an incredible collection of incredibly ornate tombs and memorials, some costing hundreds of thousands of US dollars to construct.
The buildings incorporate both Buddhist and Christian iconography, some of which are modelled after the royal tombs of the emperors of the Nguyen Dynasty.
Notice the detailed mosaics made from broken pottery that adorn many of the facades.
About 20km past Thuan An beach, take the left turn after the small Vinh An Hospital and follow the road till it ends.
.
Located immediately behind Thai Hoa Palace, on either side of a courtyard, these halls were used by mandarins as offices and to prepare for court ceremonies.
The hall on the right showcases intriguing old photographs (including boy-king Vua Duya Tan’s coronation), gilded Buddha statues and assorted imperial curios.
Behind the courtyard are the ruins of the Can Chanh Palace, where two wonderful long galleries, painted in gleaming scarlet lacquer, have been reconstructed.
.
The stunning, partially ruined Dien Tho Residence (1804) once comprised the apartments and audience hall of the Queen Mothers of the Nguyen dynasty.
The audience hall houses an exhibition of photos illustrating its former use, and there is a display of embroidered royal garments.
Just outside, a pleasure pavilion above a lily pond has been transformed into acafeworthy of a refreshment stop.
.
A classic covered Japanese footbridge in picturesque countryside, this makes a lovely diversion from Hue.
The bridge is in sleepy Thuy Thanh village, 7km east of Hue.
Head north for a few hundred metres on Ð Ba Trieu until you see a sign to the Citadel Hotel.
Turn right and follow the bumpy dirt road for another 6km past villages, rice paddies and several pagodas.
.
In 1844, Emperor Thieu Tri described this as one of Hue's most beautiful spots, but it was devastated by war.
Check out the superb entrance gate with prancing dragons and phoenixes, and the oval moat.
The exterior has been restored, while the interior remains empty, except for its elaborate columns and tiles.
.
Hire a scooter and head out to this picturesque spot on the edge of the lagoon either at sunrise or sunset, when there are beautiful views of the rising or setting sun across the fishing boats.
To make a meal of it, dine on seafood at one of the stilted restaurants.
.
Closed for mysterious reasons in 2006, this long-abandoned water park outside Hue centres on a dramatic dragon head poking from the waters of Thuy Tien Lake (Ho Thuy Tien).
Cross the bridges to the dragon's head, where you can climb up the internal stairs through a scene of graffiti-strewn dereliction and broken glass to great views from the dragon's mouth.
Note this place is falling apart and potentially dangerous (an unofficial ticketing system exists whereby you pay the guard at the gate) – take appropriate care.
From the gate, walk down between the trees and turn left at the fork to go downhill to the lake.
Soft drink and sugar-cane-juice sellers muster within the surrounding trees, vocally selling their wares.
At the time of writing, the waterpark was (unofficially) open and accessible, but it's possible it may be closed in future, so check with your hotel before going.
The only way to get out here is by hiring a driver, best done as a day or half-day tour.
.
Overlooking Dong Ba Canal, this pagoda was built under Emperor Thieu Tri’s rule (1841–47) and is celebrated for its four low towers, one on either side of the gate and two flanking the sanctuary.
The pavilions on either side of the main sanctuary entrance contain the 18 La Han(arhat),whose rank is just below that of bodhisattva, and the eight Kim Cang, protectors of Buddha.
In the back row of the main dais is Thich Ca Buddha, flanked by two assistants.
Dieu De was a stronghold of Buddhist and student opposition to the South Vietnamese government and the American War, and many arrests were made here when police stormed the building in 1966.
The rear halls of the pagoda were undergoing some heavy restoration at the time of writing.
.
Located just inside the Citadel ramparts, near the gates to either side of the Flag Tower, are the Nine Holy Cannons (1804), symbolic protectors of the palace and kingdom.
Commissioned by Emperor Gia Long, they were never intended to be fired.
Thefour cannonsnearNgan Gaterepresent the four seasons, while thefive cannonsnext toQuang Duc Gaterepresent the five elements: metal, wood, water, fire and earth.
Each brass cannon is 5m long and weighs about 10 tonnes.
.
This 1803 palace is a spacious hall with an ornate timber roof supported by 80 carved and lacquered columns.
It was used for the emperor’s official receptions and important ceremonies.
On state occasions the emperor sat on his elevated throne, facing visitors entering via the Ngo Mon Gate.
No photos are permitted, but be sure to see the impressive audiovisual display, which gives an excellent overview of the entire Citadel, its architecture and the historical context.
The Thai Hoa Palace is modelled on the Taihe Dian (Palace of Supreme Harmony) in Beijing's Forbidden City.
.
The exquisite (though crumbling) little two-storey Emperor’s Reading Room was the only part of the Purple Forbidden City to escape damage during the French reoccupation of Hue in 1947.
The Gaudí-esque, yin-yang roof mosaics outside are in stark contrast to the sombre, renovated interior, the circular hallway of which you can walk around on the small ground level.
The exterior features poems by Emperor Khai Dinh on either side; the threechu nhocharacters above the main portico translate as 'Building of Great Peace'.
.
This museum is located in the baroque-influencedAn Dinh Palace, commissioned by Emperor Khai Dinh in 1918 and full of elaborate murals, floral motifs andtrompe l'oeildetails.
