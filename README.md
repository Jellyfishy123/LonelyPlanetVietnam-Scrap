Content scrap from https://www.lonelyplanet.com/vietnam and converted it into a text file. There are up to 20 regions/cities in Vietnam and each of them have 5 factors: attractions, restaurants, nightlife, entertainment, shopping and hotels. Data varies from region to region and as bigger cities tend to have more information compared to less touristy locations. However, dataset is stil too small to train an LLM model.
